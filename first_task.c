/* Task description:


We can get any element of an arithmetic sequence (arithmetic progression) by adding the common difference to the previous element:

an = an-1 + d

Considering the sequence as a function, realize a recursive function than returns the nth element of the sequence! The parameters of the function are: arithmetig_seq(n, start, diff), the sequence number of the required element, the starting value and the difference. What shall be the base case for this recursion?

Realize a similar (recursive) function that returns the nth element of a geometric sequence. The definition is very similar to AP but a quotient is given and multiple instaed of add:

bn = bn-1 · q

Complete the program to print the first 10 elements of the sequences! For arithmetic, the base case is 1 and it is increasing by 5, for geometric sequence the first element is 2 and the multiplication factor is 2.
